2,Figure 10,"The image is a line graph that compares electricity usage in kilowatt-hours (kWh) over several months, specifically from April to March, among three categories: ""You,"" ""Similar Homes,"" and ""Efficient Homes.""

### Key Features:

- **Axis**: 
  - The vertical axis (y-axis) represents electricity usage in kilowatt-hours (kWh), ranging from 0 to 200 kWh.
  - The horizontal axis (x-axis) denotes the months from April to March.

- **Data Lines**: 
  - **You**: Represented by a blue line. It shows varying usage levels throughout the months.
  - **Similar Homes**: Indicated by an orange line, which fluctuates but generally stays above your usage.
  - **Efficient Homes**: Shown with a green line, indicating lower electricity usage compared to both ""You"" and ""Similar Homes.""

### Trends:
- The blue line for ""You"" shows peaks and dips over the months, indicating fluctuating electricity consumption.
- The orange line for ""Similar Homes"" is consistently higher than the blue line, suggesting that the user's consumption is lower compared to similar homes.
- The green line for ""Efficient Homes"" consistently remains the lowest, illustrating the least energy usage among the categories.

Overall, the graph visually communicates how the user's electricity consumption compares with that of similar and more energy-efficient homes throughout the specified period.",31,90.966796875
