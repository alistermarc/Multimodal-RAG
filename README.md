# Multimodal RAG Pipeline for Document Analysis

This project outlines a complete, end-to-end pipeline for processing PDF documents to build a multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. The pipeline extracts text and figures from a document, generates AI-powered summaries for the figures, and builds a hybrid search retriever that can answer questions using both text and image context.

A crucial part of this pipeline is the dynamic retrieval stage, which brings the multimodal capabilities to life. In this process, the extracted figures are first summarized by an AI. It is these text-based summaries that are stored and embedded in the vector database, while the original image files are kept in a local folder. When a user's query retrieves a chunk containing a figure's summary, the system is designed to fetch the corresponding original image from the folder. This image‚Äînot its summary‚Äîis then sent to the multimodal language model as direct visual context, allowing the AI to generate a comprehensive answer based on both the textual and visual information.

The workflow is broken down into major steps, which should be run in order within Jupyter Notebook.
